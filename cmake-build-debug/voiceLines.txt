Free me of my afflictions, I beg of you... Save me from this torment that gnaws at my soul... But dare you attack me?
I beseech you, free me from the chains of despair that bind me... Grant me reprieve from the torment that haunts my every step... But should you even think to lay a finger on me? Beware the wrath that awaits!
Grant me freedom from this unending torment... Rescue me from the abyss that threatens to swallow me whole...
I remember.... No ... It's all..... Evil.... DIE!
Oppose me? Know that I will not go down without a fight!
I hear the voices of the damned... They call out to me... They beckon me to join them... But I refuse! I will not be consumed by the darkness! Begone I shall fall you!
